<span class="drop_cap">W</span><span class="first_word">e</span> set off early today, the first leg of our two-day trip was 365 kilometres and we wanted to take it easy, soak in a side of the island that we had never experienced before.

When we left, it was dark. We had ridden about fifty kilometres, and we were well on our way to [Paphos](https://goo.gl/maps/ATfurAj6KH8SgiXU9) from [Limassol](https://goo.gl/maps/yYH9h2xR1HKDNT8s5) before we became aware of any light. We caught the first spark of dawn in the rearview mirror. Soon the sunrise was engulfing with fire and crimson the sky behind us, but we were still riding towards the night, the moon, the stars, the unknown.

We put up a struggle with daylight between the bends near the ancient [Kourion amphitheatre](https://goo.gl/maps/L4y7gBx5ycTjiycR9) and on the coastal road to [Petra tou Romiou](https://goo.gl/maps/8AhYtASGhxNbtEn16), where Venus was born. Right there, the moon ceased its resistance and became one with the sun, giving birth to a day full of gifts.

In this newfound light, we discovered the hills after Paphos, in the northmost part of the Republic. Here, the green, almost untouched vegetation dives into the Mediterranean without obstacles created by human intervention. A beautiful sight, which served only as the overture to what was coming.

We soon had covered almost 200 kilometres, had crossed the [Yesilirmak border](https://goo.gl/maps/Y33TLDit3E96NVJm6), and were struck by an incredible realisation: on the north side of the boarder, the sky is bluer, the sea cleaner, the hillsides greener. There are buildings, of course, but it seems like most of the country remains as of yet unspoiled.

After riding undisturbed for another 150 kilometres on asphalt washed out by the unrelenting sun, we finally stopped here, in [Yeni Erenköy](https://goo.gl/maps/9ZZFGrLL9mLHNicp6). Our phones weren’t working, the roads are not marked, and we couldn’t find the place where we were supposed to spend the night. We could have given in to tiredness and frustration, but instead we trusted the process and something wonderful happened. We asked for help at the local tourist information centre; the kind lady there didn’t know our hosts, so she went to the postman, who of course knows everybody. They offered to use a local phone to call our hosts, who came and chaperoned us to our accommodation. This gesture was a small thing, but we like to think that it has a twofold meaning: regardless of political issues and widespread assumptions, the people that live on this side of Cyprus are people like everyone else; and if you meet the world with kindness and trust, you’ll receive kindness and trust in return.

We are not historians or political scientists, we don’t know everything that went and is going on, we might know nothing, but one thing we know for sure: we are glad to be riding on these roads.
