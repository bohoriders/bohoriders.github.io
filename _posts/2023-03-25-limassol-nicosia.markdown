Riding in Cyprus is not always easy. The winter has been really windy this last two years,and a scorching summer makes your skin melt inside your jacket. This early spring morning wasn't windy and, even if the clouds look utterly filled with rain, we decided to take it as a sign and take a day trip. Being rained on is part of life after all.

Riding under the leaden-hued sky is not at all bad. The breeze is uplifting and the scenery, less saturated in colour, takes on a whole different look. 

The beautiful thing about motorcycling in Cyprus is that you can start from the seaside and ride to the highest peak in a couple of hours, enjoying the steep climb as you smoothly slither to the curves. 

This early morning on a bank holiday was ideal: with no one else on the road, we let the bike dictate the pace, melting its soul with ours. Motorcycling is more than a hobby, more than a sport, more than a fancy. It is a practice.

Like in meditation, yoga, or martial arts, riding requires the symbiosis of body and mind, a state of constant and deep awareness that encompasses both the world within and that without. At every turn, you slow down, let the road flow through you; you are alert of the dangers and let the beauty and peace of the woods, the hills, the sea fill you with joy and wonder. At the same time you let go what has been and have no expectation for what's coming: you are living every moment as it comes. You are utterly and perfectly present.

At 2,000 meters above sea level we can see the Mediterranean, Limassol, and its harbour. We started from down there and now we are observing it from a vantage point, from a removed perspective that grants clarity. Being able to see where we started is really a testament to how far we have comeâ€”and we mean in our journey as a whole. It is like the ancient Greeks thought of time: your past stands in front of you, because you know it and you can see it; while your future stands behind you, because you don't know what's coming. For us, the future is behind the next bend in the road, we take it firmly but without expectations, confiding that the new view will hold exactly what we need.

A motorcycle is just a tool: two wheels, and engine, and a few other bits of engineering. It hasn't changed much since its inception and maybe there is a good reason for that: it keeps us glued to the road, and yet we don't have to wonder any longer what it feels like to have wings.
