<span class="drop_cap">A</span><span class="first_word">s</span> we set out on the second day of our road trip through North Cyprus, we were filled with excitement and anticipation for the adventures that awaited us. The first day had been full of pleasant surprises, and we couldn’t wait to get back on the bike. The island's stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage promised to be a feast for the senses, and we were eager to explore every corner of this enchanting land. Little did we know that our journey would also be filled with unexpected friendliness, warm hospitality, and awe-inspiring sights that would stay with us long after returning home.

As we rolled down the roads, deserted that early in the morning, we had the opportunity to take in and admire the scenery. I think that, maybe for the first time, we had the chance to really appreciate the beauty of the Mediterranean scrub. The lush and rich green was endless, interrupted only by the yellow of the flowers and the deep blue of the sea. Above us, the sky was still of marvellous shades of pink and orange, but was quickly becoming stunningly azure.

As we swallowed kilometres, the coast glided before our eyes and the grand rocks that regularly and fiercely jut out from the sea, facing towards the coast, resembled mythological creatures standing guard to the island.

Still early in the morning, we arrived in the small town of [Dipkarpaz](https://goo.gl/maps/jksY1LCPCjwMhA4h6), which is the only place on the entire island where the Greek and the Turkish traditions live in harmony. This is the town where the bell tower stands next to the minaret, where the Orthodox Christian lives next to the Muslim, where the Greek Cypriot works next to the Turkish Cypriot, where Cypriot coffee and Turkish coffee are poured in neighbouring establishments along the main street and drunk together. In Dipkarpaz you can feel this peace in the air and breathe it in, let it wash over you, and ease you up.

Continuing towards the easternmost part of the island, we entered again very sparsely populated lands, but we found that the cordiality and kindness of the people didn’t stay within the limits of the town centres. Along the roads, the streets, and the narrow ways, people wave at you for no reason at all and make you feel right at home, like you belong there.

As our trip approached the end, a mix of emotions pervaded us. On one hand, we were sad to say goodbye to this enchanting land, with its stunning natural beauty and warm hospitality. On the other, we felt grateful for the memories we had made, the unexpected surprises we had experienced, and the profound sense of harmony we had witnessed. The whole journey reminded us that, despite our differences, we all share a common bond as human beings, and that peace and understanding are possible, even in the most unlikely of places.
